                    <p1>Hello! My name is Nicholas Jaimes (or Nico) and I'm a third year computer science major from Alpharetta!
                        I chose to be a CS major to help people, so I think Bits of Good would be perfect for me!

                        Some hobbies of mine include going to concerts, working out, but especially travelling! 
                        The picture on the right is of me in the Dominican Republic, and I've been to over 20 countries!
                        The unique cultures of these places are really fascinating to me and I hope someday to contribute
                        to the preservation of these cultures.
                    </p1>
